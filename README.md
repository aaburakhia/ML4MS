# The ML4MS Initiative
**Machine Learning for Materials Science**

### 🔭 The Mission
The gap between Academic AI (finding new crystals) and Industrial Engineering (Asset Integrity) is too wide. **ML4MS** is an initiative to scout emerging technologies and critique their viability for safety-critical operations (Oil & Gas).

### [01. Can We Trust AI with Sour Service Design?](explorations/01-crystalyse-review.md)
*Dec 2025 | Topic: LLM Hallucinations & Provenance*

A critical review of the paper **"Crystalyse"** (Imperial College London). Standard AI models "hallucinate" material properties, making them unsafe for NACE MR0175 compliance. I tested a "Render Gate" architecture that forces AI to use cryptographic proof.
