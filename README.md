# ML4MS: Machine Learning for Materials Science
**The Engineering Layer for Artificial Intelligence**

---

> ### 🔭 The Mission
> The gap between **Academic AI** (finding new crystals) and **Industrial Engineering** (Asset Integrity) is too wide.
>
> **ML4MS** is a knowledge initiative dedicated to scouting emerging technologies and critiquing their viability for safety-critical operations. We move beyond "Chatbots" to build **Engineering Agents** that respect physics, adhere to global standards (NACE, API, ASTM), and operate with zero-trust architecture.

### [Can We Trust AI with Sour Service Design?]({% link _posts/2025-12-05-crystalyse-review.md %})
**Date:** Dec 5, 2025 | **Topic:** *Asset Integrity, LLM Hallucinations, Provenance*

Generative AI has a "Hallucination Problem." In creative writing, it's a feature. In Material Selection for $H_2S$ environments, it is a liability.

In this analysis, I review the breakthrough paper **"Crystalyse"** (Imperial College London, 2025) and implement its "Render Gate" architecture to solve this problem.

*   **The Concept:** Moving from "Probabilistic Guessing" to "Provenance-Enforced Calculation."
*   **The Experiment:** I built a live prototype agent that calculates **PREN** (Pitting Resistance) using a deterministic physics engine, enforcing a digital audit trail for safety-critical alloys.
*   **The Verdict:** AI is ready for industry, *if* wrapped in the right safety architecture.

## 🧭 The Research Radar
*Active investigations at the intersection of AI and Heavy Industry.*

#### 1. Accelerated Discovery & Generative Design
Investigating how Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models are creating new alloy compositions for Aerospace and Additive Manufacturing, and how we validate these "dreamed" materials against physical constraints.

#### 2. Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PINNs)
Moving beyond traditional Finite Element Analysis (FEA). We are exploring how neural networks can solve differential equations for corrosion rates, heat transfer, and stress analysis 100x faster than traditional simulation methods.

#### 3. Computer Vision in Characterization
Automating the analysis of SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) and metallography images. Using CNNs to detect micro-cracks, calculate phase fractions, and identify failure mechanisms instantly.

### 📡 Automated Intelligence Pipeline
*Behind the scenes of ML4MS*

To keep this initiative current, I maintain an automated **n8n data pipeline** that scans pre-print servers (arXiv) and major journals daily. It uses Natural Language Processing to filter noise and surface high-impact research relevant to industrial materials engineering.
