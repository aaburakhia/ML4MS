# ML4MS: Machine Learning for Materials Science
**Decoding the AI Revolution for Physical Engineering**

---

### 🔭 The Mission
The field of Materials Science is undergoing a paradigm shift. From Google DeepMind's crystal discoveries to Large Language Models that understand chemistry, the landscape is changing faster than industry can adapt.

**ML4MS** is a knowledge initiative dedicated to bridging the gap between **Academic AI Research** and **Real-World Engineering**.

We are not just a coding repository. We are an open exploration of:
*   **What is new?** Scouting the latest papers from arXiv, Nature, and Science.
*   **What is real?** Separating hype from viable engineering tools.
*   **How do we use it?** Prototyping workflows to see how AI applies to Metallurgy, Polymers, Composites, and Asset Integrity.

### [01. Agentic AI & The Future of Design Standards](./explorations/01-crystalyse-review.md)
*Focus: GenAI, Large Language Models, Engineering Compliance*

Can we trust Generative AI to design safety-critical materials?
In this deep dive, I review the paper **"Crystalyse"** (Imperial College London, 2025). It proposes a new architecture where AI doesn't just "guess" properties but acts as an orchestrator—using physics tools and cryptographic verification to ensure safety.

*   **The Concept:** Moving from "Chatbots" to "Provenance-Enforced Agents."
*   **The Experiment:** I built a live prototype demonstrating how this works for NACE MR0175 standards.

## 🧭 The Roadmap: What We Are Exploring
ML4MS is actively investigating the following frontiers:

#### 1. Accelerated Discovery & Generative Design
How Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models are creating new alloy compositions for Aerospace and Additive Manufacturing.

#### 2. Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PINNs)
Moving beyond traditional Finite Element Analysis (FEA). How neural networks can solve differential equations for corrosion rates, heat transfer, and stress analysis 100x faster than traditional simulation.

#### 3. Computer Vision in Characterization
Automating the analysis of SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) and metallography images. Using CNNs to detect micro-cracks, phase fractions, and failure mechanisms instantly.

### 📡 Automated Intelligence Pipeline
*Behind the scenes of ML4MS*

To keep this initiative current, I maintain an automated **n8n data pipeline** that scans pre-print servers (arXiv) and major journals daily. It uses NLP to filter noise and surface high-impact research relevant to industrial materials engineering.
